# HB_pybinding
Code for the calculation of Hofstadter's Butterfly for 2D COFs based on Pybinding.

Relies on ASE and pybinding. The Tight-Binding parameters are extracted from slater-koster files (can be downloaded here: https://dftb.org/parameters).

Usage is shown in the example jupyter notebook.
